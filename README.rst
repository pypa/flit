**Flit** is a simple way to put Python packages and modules on PyPI.

Why Flit
-------
* Flit enables you to publish your package to PyPI in a simple three step process ``flit init``, ``build`` & ``publish``.
* Wheels built by flit are `reproducible <https://flit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/reproducible.html/>`_ : if you build from the same source code, you should be able to make wheels that are exactly identical, byte for byte. This is useful for verifying software. For more details, see reproducible-builds.org.

Install
-------

::

    $ python3 -m pip install flit

Flit requires Python 3 and therefore needs to be installed using the Python 3
version of pip.

Python 2 modules can be distributed using Flit, but need to be importable on
Python 3 without errors.

Usage
-----

Say you're writing a module ``foobar`` — either as a single file ``foobar.py``,
or as a directory — and you want to distribute it.

1. Make sure that foobar's docstring starts with a one-line summary of what
   the module is, and that it has a ``__version__``:

   .. code-block:: python

       """An amazing sample package!"""

       __version__ = '0.1'

2. Install flit if you don't already have it::

       python3 -m pip install flit

3. Run ``flit init`` to create a ``pyproject.toml`` file. It will look something
   like this:

   .. code-block:: ini

       [build-system]
       requires = ["flit"]
       build-backend = "flit.buildapi"

       [tool.flit.metadata]
       module = "foobar"
       author = "Sir Robin"
       author-email = "robin@camelot.uk"
       home-page = "https://github.com/sirrobin/foobar"

   You can edit this file to add other metadata, for example to set up
   command line scripts. See the
   `pyproject.toml page <https://flit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/pyproject_toml.html#scripts-section>`_
   of the documentation.

   If you have already got a ``flit.ini`` file to use with older versions of
   Flit, it will still work for now, but you should convert it to
   ``pyproject.toml`` when convenient.

4. Run this command to upload your code to PyPI::

       flit publish

Once your package is published, people can install it using *pip* just like
any other package. In most cases, pip will download a 'wheel' package, a
standard format it knows how to install. If you specifically ask pip to install
an 'sdist' package, it will install and use Flit in a temporary environment.


To install a package locally for development, run::

    flit install [--symlink] [--python path/to/python]

Flit packages a single importable module or package at a time, using the import
name as the name on PyPI. All subpackages and data files within a package are
included automatically.

Development
-----------

To install the development version of Flit from Github::

    git clone https://github.com/takluyver/flit.git
    cd flit
    python3 -m pip install docutils requests pytoml
    python3 -m flit install

You may want to use the ``--symlink`` or ``--pth-file`` options so you can test
changes without reinstalling it.

To run the tests, run ``pytest``.
